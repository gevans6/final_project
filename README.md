####Project Description

We will be working with the Enrollment Status of the Population 3 Years Old and Over, by Sex, Age, Race, Hispanic Origin, Foreign Born, and Foreign-Born Parentage supplied by Child Protective Services of the United States.  This dataset was updated in October 2014. This data was accessed though the census.gov website, routed through the United States’ public data domain, data.gov. This data was collected through the United States census. Our project will explore whether or not gender, race/ethnicity, or if students are foreign-born or have foreign-born parents appear to contribute to withdrawal from school, ages three and older. Our target audience includes education officials who will use the information to target students who we find to be more likely to withdraw from school.

####Technical Description

We will be creating a HTML document. We will be comparing twelve different .csv files, separated by the ethnicity and the “born status” of students. In order to compare these files, we will need to reformat each file that has unnecessary rows, columns, and merged cells so that it will be easier to join the files. We are anticipating using some combination of ggplot2, ggvis, and htmlwidgets, in addition to several common libraries. We will not be using any outside statistical analysis or machine learning software to answer our questions.  We will manipulate the data, present it visually, and draw conclusions. The major challenges we are anticipating are version control issues and figuring out the most effective visual representations to answer our questions.
